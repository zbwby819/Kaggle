My first Kaggle competition.  2017/11-2017/12 
End up Top 13% (419th/3343)
Methods: (CNN based classification + stacking different CNN models)      
1.Training my own CNNs from scratch with 10-cross validation.(NiN + All convolution + Global pooling)  
2.Using pre-trained models.(InceptionV3, Resnet50, VGG16, Densenet121)  
3.Stacking.(Best model*0.5 + others*0.5, cliping, voting for highest prediction)    

Cons: No time for incorporating additional feature information(angles). Turns out the angle feature is the key to further improve accuracy.
